                }
            }
        }
    }
}
ChatGPT
The error you're encountering is likely due to the fact that you're using single quotes (' ') around the text "Click me" inside the Text composable. In Kotlin, single quotes are used for character literals, not string literals.

To fix the error, you should use double quotes (" ") around the text "Click me":

kotlin
Copy code
Button(onClick = {
    count++
}) {
    Text(text = "Click me")
}
With this change, the code should compile without any errors.

User
can you write Python code that picks the crypto coin and show historic price data
ChatGPT
Sure, below is an example Python code using the ccxt library to fetch historical price data for a selected cryptocurrency from the Binance exchange. This example retrieves historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for Bitcoin (BTC) against USDT (Tether) pair for the past 30 days.

First, make sure you have the ccxt library installed. You can install it via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install ccxt
Here's the Python code:

python
Copy code
import ccxt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize the Binance exchange
exchange = ccxt.binance()

# Define the symbol (e.g., BTC/USDT for Bitcoin against USDT pair)
symbol = 'BTC/USDT'

# Define the timeframe ('1d' for daily)
timeframe = '1d'

# Calculate the start and end timestamps (e.g., past 30 days)
end_timestamp = exchange.milliseconds()
start_timestamp = end_timestamp - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000

# Fetch historical OHLCV data
ohlcv_data = exchange.fetch_ohlcv(symbol, timeframe, since=start_timestamp, limit=1000)

# Convert timestamps to human-readable format
formatted_data = [[datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp / 1000).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] + data[1:] for timestamp, *data in ohlcv_data]

# Print the data
for row in formatted_data:
    print(row)
This code will print the historical OHLCV data for Bitcoin against USDT pair for the past 30 days. You can modify the symbol variable to choose a different cryptocurrency pair, and adjust the timeframe and time range as needed. Additionally, you can customize the output format or perform further analysis on the fetched data as per your requirements.

['2024-01-23 00:00:00', 2351.31, 2168.65, 2243.06, 10470.71625726]
what does :0470.71625726 mean?
ChatGPT
In the provided data:

'2024-01-23 00:00:00' represents the timestamp of the data point, indicating that it was recorded on January 23, 2024, at midnight (00:00:00).
2351.31 represents the opening price of the cryptocurrency at the given timestamp.
2168.65 represents the lowest price (low) of the cryptocurrency during the time period.
2243.06 represents the highest price (high) of the cryptocurrency during the time period.
10470.71625726 appears to represent the trading volume of the cryptocurrency during the time period.
The value 10470.71625726 likely represents the trading volume of the cryptocurrency within the given time period (in this case, it could be a day), measured in the cryptocurrency itself (e.g., Bitcoin) or its equivalent value in another currency (e.g., USD).

Trading volume refers to the total number of units of the cryptocurrency that were traded during the specified time period. It provides insight into the level of activity in the market for that particular cryptocurrency during that time period.

The value 10470.71625726 would typically mean that 10470.71625726 units of the cryptocurrency were traded during the specified time period. The exact interpretation may depend on the context and the units used for trading volume (e.g., number of coins, monetary value).

User
I only want to see 2 digits after '.' in 10470.71625726?
ChatGPT
To display only two digits after the decimal point in the value 10470.71625726, you can round the number to two decimal places. Here's how you can do it in Python:

python
Copy code
# Example data
trading_volume = 10470.71625726

# Round the trading volume to two decimal places
rounded_volume = round(trading_volume, 2)

print(rounded_volume)
This will output:

Copy code
10470.72
The value 10470.71625726 has been rounded to two decimal places, resulting in 10470.72. If you simply want to truncate the digits after the decimal point without rounding, you can use string formatting to achieve that:

python
Copy code
# Example data
trading_volume = 10470.71625726

# Truncate the trading volume to two decimal places
truncated_volume = "{:.2f}".format(trading_volume)

print(truncated_volume)
This will also output:

Copy code
10470.72
Both methods will result in the same output, but rounding may affect values differently when the third decimal place is greater than or equal to 5. If you want to specifically truncate the digits after the decimal point without rounding, you can use string formatting.

User
where is 'trading_volume ' in formatted_data = [[datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp / 1000).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]
                  + data[1:] for timestamp, *data in ohlcv_data]
ChatGPT
In the expression:

python
Copy code
formatted_data = [[datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp / 1000).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]
                  + data[1:] for timestamp, *data in ohlcv_data]
The variable formatted_data is a list comprehension that iterates over the elements of ohlcv_data, which likely contains OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for a cryptocurrency.

In this list comprehension, each element of ohlcv_data is unpacked into the variables timestamp and data. The timestamp variable represents the timestamp of the OHLCV data point, and the data variable is a list containing the OHLCV values (open, high, low, close, volume) for that timestamp.

The expression datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp / 1000).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') converts the UNIX timestamp (in milliseconds) into a human-readable date and time format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). This formatted date and time string is the first element of each sublist in formatted_data.

The data[1:] part of the expression represents a slice of the data list, starting from the second element (index 1) to the end. This slice contains the OHLCV values excluding the opening price (the first element), which is typically the timestamp in the OHLCV dataset.

Therefore, data[1:] contains the high, low, close, and volume values for each data point, while the timestamp is represented by the formatted date and time string. The trading_volume is part of data[4], as the volume value is typically the fifth element (index 4) in the OHLCV dataset.

ChatGPT
The error you're encountering (Unresolved reference: compose_version) indicates that the variable compose_version is not defined in your build.gradle.kts file.

To resolve this issue, you need to define compose_version somewhere in your Gradle script. Typically, this variable holds the version of Jetpack Compose that you want to use in your project.

Here's an example of how you can define compose_version at the top of your build.gradle.kts file:

kotlin
Copy code
// Define the Jetpack Compose version
val compose_version = "1.1.0-beta01" // Replace with the desired version of Jetpack Compose
Place this line at the top of your build.gradle.kts file, before the dependencies block. Ensure that you replace "1.1.0-beta01" with the version of Jetpack Compose that you want to use in your project.

After defining compose_version, your dependencies block should be able to resolve the reference to this variable, and the error should be resolved. Make sure to sync your project with Gradle after making these changes.

how to find a keyword in ADB logs and retrieve the full line where that keyword is found
ChatGPT
You can use the adb logcat command along with grep to filter the logs for a specific keyword and retrieve the full lines where that keyword is found. Here's how you can do it:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Connect your Android device to your computer via USB and ensure that USB debugging is enabled on your device.

Run the following command to view the logcat logs in real-time:

Copy code
adb logcat
To filter the logs for a specific keyword (let's say "keyword"), you can use grep. Run the following command:

perl
Copy code
adb logcat | grep "keyword"
This command will display only the log lines that contain the specified keyword.

If you want to retrieve the full lines where the keyword is found, you can use the -C flag with grep to display context lines. For example, to display 5 lines before and after each matching line:

mathematica
Copy code
adb logcat | grep -C 5 "keyword"
Adjust the number (5 in this example) to change the number of context lines displayed before and after each matching line.

Using the grep command in combination with adb logcat allows you to filter and retrieve log lines containing a specific keyword on your Android device.

User
how can I do that using Python?
ChatGPT
You can use Python's subprocess module to execute the adb logcat command and then parse the output to find the lines containing your keyword. Here's a Python script to achieve that:

python
Copy code
import subprocess

def search_logs(keyword, context_lines=0):
    # Run adb logcat command
    process = subprocess.Popen(['adb', 'logcat'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

    # Iterate over each line of the output
    for line in iter(process.stdout.readline, b''):
        # Decode the line from bytes to string
        line = line.decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Check if the line contains the keyword
        if keyword in line:
            # Print the line
            print(line)
            # Print context lines if specified
            if context_lines > 0:
                for _ in range(context_lines):
                    prev_line = process.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
                    print(prev_line)

# Example usage: Search for keyword "error" with 2 context lines
search_logs("error", context_lines=2)
This script defines a function search_logs that takes a keyword and an optional context_lines parameter. It executes the adb logcat command using subprocess.Popen, reads the output line by line, and prints the lines containing the specified keyword. If context_lines is greater than 0, it also prints the specified number of context lines before each matching line.

You can customize the keyword and context_lines parameters as needed for your use case. Additionally, make sure that you have adb (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your system and added to your system's PATH for this script to work.

User
how can I use this function to find keyword in a file
ChatGPT
If you want to search for a keyword in a file using a Python function similar to the one provided earlier, you can modify the function to read from a file instead of executing the adb logcat command. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
def search_file(filename, keyword, context_lines=0):
    try:
        # Open the file for reading
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            # Iterate over each line of the file
            for line in file:
                # Strip newline characters and check if the line contains the keyword
                if keyword in line.strip():
                    # Print the line
                    print(line.strip())
                    # Print context lines if specified
                    if context_lines > 0:
                        for _ in range(context_lines):
                            prev_line = file.readline().strip()
                            print(prev_line)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filename}' not found.")

# Example usage: Search for keyword "error" in file "example.log" with 2 context lines
search_file("example.log", "error", context_lines=2)
This function search_file takes three parameters: filename, keyword, and context_lines. It reads from the specified file (filename), iterates over each line, and prints the lines containing the specified keyword. If context_lines is greater than 0, it also prints the specified number of context lines before each matching line.

You can customize the filename, keyword, and context_lines parameters as needed for your use case. Just make sure to provide the correct filename containing the logs you want to search through.

User
how can I retrive this data '17:02:19.688' form ADB line using Python
ChatGPT
To retrieve the data '17:02:19.688' from an ADB line using Python, you can use regular expressions (regex). Regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to search for patterns within strings. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
import re

def extract_timestamp(line):
    # Define a regular expression pattern to match the timestamp format
    timestamp_pattern = r'\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d{3}'  # Matches the format 'HH:MM:SS.MMM'

    # Search for the timestamp pattern in the line
    match = re.search(timestamp_pattern, line)

    # If a match is found, return the matched timestamp
    if match:
        return match.group(0)
    else:
        return None

# Example usage: Extract timestamp from an ADB line
adb_line = "02-20 17:02:19.688 1234 5678 I/Tag: Message"
timestamp = extract_timestamp(adb_line)
print(timestamp)  # Output: 17:02:19.688
In this code:

The extract_timestamp function takes a string line (an ADB log line) as input.
The timestamp_pattern variable defines a regular expression pattern to match the timestamp format 'HH:MM:SS.MMM' (hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds).
The re.search function searches for the timestamp pattern in the line.
If a match is found (match is not None), match.group(0) returns the matched timestamp.
If no match is found, the function returns None.
You can use this extract_timestamp function to extract timestamps from ADB log lines in your Python script.

how to calculate time difference using Python?
ChatGPT
To calculate the time difference between two timestamps in Python, you can use the datetime module. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_time_difference(start_time, stop_time, time_format='%H:%M:%S.%f'):
    # Parse the start and stop times into datetime objects
    start_datetime = datetime.strptime(start_time, time_format)
    stop_datetime = datetime.strptime(stop_time, time_format)

    # Calculate the time difference
    time_diff = stop_datetime - start_datetime

    # Return the time difference as a timedelta object
    return time_diff

# Example usage
start_time = '17:02:19.688'
stop_time = '17:02:35.951'

time_difference = calculate_time_difference(start_time, stop_time)

print("Time difference:", time_difference)
In this code:

The calculate_time_difference function takes two timestamp strings (start_time and stop_time) and an optional time_format parameter (default is '%H:%M:%S.%f' for hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds).
The datetime.strptime function is used to parse the timestamp strings into datetime objects.
The time difference is calculated by subtracting the start_datetime from the stop_datetime, resulting in a timedelta object representing the difference in time.
The calculated time difference is returned.
You can adjust the time_format parameter if your timestamps have a different format. The timedelta object returned represents the time difference between the two timestamps.

User
how to convert: start_time = '17:02:19.688' to INT
ChatGPT
If you want to convert a timestamp string like '17:02:19.688' to an integer representing the number of seconds since midnight, you can first parse the timestamp string into a datetime object and then extract the total number of seconds. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
from datetime import datetime

def timestamp_to_seconds(timestamp_str):
    # Parse the timestamp string into a datetime object
    timestamp_dt = datetime.strptime(timestamp_str, '%H:%M:%S.%f')

    # Extract hours, minutes, and seconds from the datetime object
    hours = timestamp_dt.hour
    minutes = timestamp_dt.minute
    seconds = timestamp_dt.second
    microseconds = timestamp_dt.microsecond

    # Calculate the total number of seconds since midnight
    total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds + (microseconds / 1e6)

    return int(total_seconds)

# Example usage
start_time = '17:02:19.688'
start_time_seconds = timestamp_to_seconds(start_time)
print("Start time in seconds:", start_time_seconds)
In this code:

The timestamp_to_seconds function takes a timestamp string (timestamp_str) as input.
It parses the timestamp string into a datetime object using datetime.strptime.
Then, it extracts the hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds from the datetime object.
The total number of seconds since midnight is calculated by summing the number of seconds for each component (hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds).
Finally, the total number of seconds is converted to an integer using the int() function.
This will give you an integer representing the number of seconds since midnight for the given timestamp string.

User
how to dump Python variable value into a separate .json file?
ChatGPT
You can use the json module in Python to dump a Python variable's value into a JSON file. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
import json

# Example Python variable
data = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Specify the file path for the JSON file
json_file_path = "data.json"

# Dump the variable 'data' into the JSON file
with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(data, json_file, indent=4)

print(f"Variable 'data' has been dumped into '{json_file_path}'")
In this code:

We first import the json module.
We define an example Python variable data containing some key-value pairs.
We specify the file path for the JSON file where we want to dump the variable's value.
We use the json.dump() function to write the contents of the data variable into the JSON file. The indent parameter is used to specify the indentation level for formatting the JSON data.
We open the JSON file in write mode ('w') using a context manager (with statement) to ensure proper handling of the file.
After dumping the data, we print a message indicating that the variable has been dumped into the JSON file.
After running this code, you'll find a file named data.json in the specified directory containing the JSON representation of the Python variable data. Adjust the data variable and the file path according to your specific use case.

how to add data to .json file but now rewriting it over
ChatGPT
If you want to add data to an existing JSON file without overwriting its contents, you'll need to follow these steps:

Read the existing data from the JSON file.
Update the data by adding new entries or modifying existing ones.
Write the updated data back to the JSON file.
Here's how you can do it in Python:

python
Copy code
import json

# Example data to add
new_data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "Los Angeles"
}

# Specify the file path for the JSON file
json_file_path = "data.json"

# Read existing data from the JSON file, if it exists
try:
    with open(json_file_path, 'r') as json_file:
        existing_data = json.load(json_file)
except FileNotFoundError:
    # If the file doesn't exist, initialize with an empty dictionary
    existing_data = {}

# Update the existing data with the new data
existing_data.update(new_data)

# Write the updated data back to the JSON file
with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(existing_data, json_file, indent=4)

print(f"Data has been added to '{json_file_path}'")
In this code:

We define an example dictionary new_data containing the data we want to add to the JSON file.
We specify the file path for the JSON file.
We use a try block to attempt to read the existing data from the JSON file using json.load(). If the file doesn't exist, we catch the FileNotFoundError exception and initialize existing_data with an empty dictionary.
We update the existing_data dictionary with the new data using the update() method.
We write the updated data back to the JSON file using json.dump().
We print a message indicating that the data has been added to the JSON file.
After running this code, the new data will be added to the existing JSON file without overwriting its contents. Adjust the new_data dictionary and the file path according to your specific use case.

with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(new_data, json_file, indent=4)

print(f"{new_data} has been dumped into '{json_file_path}'")
ChatGPT
To modify the code so that it appends new data to the existing JSON file instead of overwriting it, you can follow these steps:

Read the existing data from the JSON file, if it exists.
Update the existing data by adding the new data to it.
Write the updated data (including both existing and new data) back to the JSON file.
Here's the modified code:

python
Copy code
import json

# Example data to add
new_data = {
    "ble_start_conn": conn_start_time,
    "ble_end_conn": conn_end_time,
    "ble_start_to_connect_duration": ble_start_to_connect_duration
}

json_file_path = "/Users/user/PycharmProjects/AppiumAutomation/test_data.json"

# Read existing data from the JSON file, if it exists
try:
    with open(json_file_path, 'r') as json_file:
        existing_data = json.load(json_file)
except FileNotFoundError:
    # If the file doesn't exist, initialize with an empty list
    existing_data = []

# Append the new data to the existing data
existing_data.append(new_data)

# Write the updated data (including both existing and new data) back to the JSON file
with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(existing_data, json_file, indent=4)

print(f"{new_data} has been appended to '{json_file_path}'")
In this modified code:

We initialize existing_data as an empty list if the JSON file doesn't exist or couldn't be loaded.
We append the new data (new_data) to the existing_data list.
We write the updated data (including both existing and new data) back to the JSON file using json.dump().
We print a message indicating that the new data has been appended to the JSON file.
This way, each time you run the code, the new data will be appended to the existing data in the JSON file. Adjust the new_data dictionary and the file path according to your specific use case.

json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
ChatGPT
The error message indicates that there was an issue decoding the JSON data from the file. The error specifically states "Expecting value", which typically means that the file is empty or does not contain valid JSON data.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following:

Check the JSON file: Make sure that the JSON file (test_data.json) exists at the specified path (/Users/user/PycharmProjects/AppiumAutomation/test_data.json). You can verify the contents of the file to ensure it contains valid JSON data.

Verify file permissions: Ensure that the Python script has the necessary permissions to read and write to the JSON file. Check the file permissions to ensure they are set correctly.

Handle empty file: If the file is empty, you should handle this case gracefully in your code. You can initialize existing_data as an empty list if the file is empty or does not contain valid JSON data.

Here's how you can modify your code to handle an empty or non-existent file:

python
Copy code
import json

# Example data to add
new_data = {
    "ble_start_conn": conn_start_time,
    "ble_end_conn": conn_end_time,
    "ble_start_to_connect_duration": ble_start_to_connect_duration
}

json_file_path = "/Users/user/PycharmProjects/AppiumAutomation/test_data.json"

# Read existing data from the JSON file, if it exists
try:
    with open(json_file_path, 'r') as json_file:
        # Try to load existing data from the file
        existing_data = json.load(json_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.decoder.JSONDecodeError):
    # If the file doesn't exist or doesn't contain valid JSON data, initialize with an empty list
    existing_data = []

# Append the new data to the existing data
existing_data.append(new_data)

# Write the updated data (including both existing and new data) back to the JSON file
with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(existing_data, json_file, indent=4)

print(f"{new_data} has been appended to '{json_file_path}'")
With this modification, the code will handle cases where the file is empty or does not contain valid JSON data, initializing existing_data as an empty list in such cases. Adjust the file path and error handling as needed based on your specific requirements.

ChatGPT
It seems like the issue is that the code is overwriting the existing data each time it writes to the JSON file, instead of appending the new data. To resolve this, you should load the existing data from the file, append the new data to it, and then write the updated data back to the file. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

python
Copy code
import json

# Example data to add
new_data = {
    "ble_start_conn": conn_start_time,
    "ble_end_conn": conn_end_time,
    "ble_start_to_connect_duration": ble_start_to_connect_duration
}

json_file_path = "/Users/user/PycharmProjects/AppiumAutomation/test_data.json"

# Read existing data from the JSON file, if it exists
try:
    with open(json_file_path, 'r') as json_file:
        # Try to load existing data from the file
        existing_data = json.load(json_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.decoder.JSONDecodeError):
    # If the file doesn't exist or doesn't contain valid JSON data, initialize with an empty list
    existing_data = []

# Append the new data to the existing data
existing_data.append(new_data)

# Write the updated data (including both existing and new data) back to the JSON file
with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(existing_data, json_file, indent=4)

print(f"{new_data} has been appended to '{json_file_path}'")
With this modification, the code will append the new data to the existing list of data each time it runs, and the JSON file will contain all the appended data. Adjust the file path and error handling as needed based on your specific requirements.

how to catch this error in Python function
'TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'float'
ChatGPT
To catch the TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'float' error in a Python function, you can use a try-except block. Here's how you can modify your function to catch and handle this specific error:

python
Copy code
def calculate_time_difference(start_time, stop_time):
    try:
        # Calculate the time difference
        time_diff = stop_time - start_time
        return time_diff
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None  # Or handle the error in a different way

# Example usage
start_time = 10.5  # Example float value
stop_time = None   # Example None value

time_difference = calculate_time_difference(start_time, stop_time)
if time_difference is not None:
    print("Time difference:", time_difference)
else:
    print("Unable to calculate time difference due to error.")
In this modified function:

We use a try-except block to catch the TypeError that occurs when trying to perform arithmetic operations (-) on a NoneType and a float.
Inside the except block, we print the error message ({e}) and handle the error in a way that suits your application, for example, by returning None.
In the example usage, we call the calculate_time_difference function with example values for start_time and stop_time. We check if the returned time_difference is not None before printing it.
Adjust the error handling and the rest of the function according to your specific requirements.

User
how to catch 2 exceptions within the same Python function?
ChatGPT
To catch multiple exceptions within the same Python function, you can use a single try block with multiple except clauses, each handling a different exception. Here's an example:

python

    try:
        # Code that may raise exceptions
        result = 1 / 0  # Example division by zero
        print(result)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero")
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Invalid value")
    # Add more except clauses for additional exceptions as needed

# Call the function
example_function()
In this example:

The try block contains the code that may raise exceptions.
Each except clause handles a specific type of exception. You can have as many except clauses as needed to handle different types of exceptions.
If an exception occurs within the try block, Python checks each except clause in order. If the exception matches the type specified in an except clause, the corresponding block of code is executed.
If none of the except clauses match the raised exception, Python continues to propagate the exception outside of the function or to the outer exception handler.
You can also catch multiple exceptions in a single except clause by specifying a tuple of exception types. For example:

python
Copy code
def example_function():
    try:
        # Code that may raise exceptions
        result = 1 / 0  # Example division by zero
        print(result)
    except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
        print("Error: Division by zero or invalid value")
    # Add more except clauses for additional exceptions as needed

# Call the function
example_function()
This syntax allows you to handle multiple exceptions with the same block of code.

The error you're encountering (TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType') indicates that ble_conn_start_time and ble_conn_end_time are both None. This happens when the search_file function doesn't find the required keyword in the log file and returns None.

To fix this issue, you should handle the case where the keyword is not found in the log file. One approach is to return None from the search_file function when the keyword is not found, and then check for None before performing any calculations in the main code.

Here's how you can modify your code to handle this:

python
Copy code
# Modify the search_file function to return None when the keyword is not found
def search_file(filename, keyword, ble_start_stop, context_lines=0):
    try:
        # Open the file for reading
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            # Iterate over each line of the file
            for line in file:
                # Strip newline characters and check if the line contains the keyword
                if keyword in line.strip():
                    print(line.strip())
                    timestamp_pattern = r'\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d{3}'
                    match = re.search(timestamp_pattern, line)
                    if match:
                        print(f"{ble_start_stop} is: {match.group(0)}")
                        match_int = datetime.strptime(str(match.group(0)), '%H:%M:%S.%f')
                        hours = match_int.hour
                        minutes = match_int.minute
                        seconds = match_int.second
                        microseconds = match_int.microsecond
                        total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds + (microseconds / 1e6)
                        print(f"____total seconds:{total_seconds}")
                        return total_seconds
                    else:
                        return None
            print("no required <keyword> found in the log")
            return None  # Return None if keyword not found
    except FileNotFoundError as fileNotFoundError:
        print(f"<{fileNotFoundError}>Error: File '{filename}' not found.")
    except TypeError as typeError:
        print(f"{typeError}")

# Check for None before performing calculations in the main code
if ble_conn_start_time is not None and ble_conn_end_time is not None:
    ble_start_to_success_connect_duration = round(ble_conn_end_time - ble_conn_start_time, 2)
elif ble_conn_start_time is not None and ble_failed_conn_time is not None:
    ble_start_to_failed_connect_duration = round(ble_failed_conn_time - ble_conn_start_time, 2)
else:
    print(iteration_failed_to_launch)
With this modification, the search_file function returns None when the keyword is not found, and the main code checks for None before performing calculations. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring when trying to subtract None from None.
